in structural and procedural programming there is too much data insecurity ----due to global variables
---as non important functions can also impact the important global variables----to prevent that CLASS IS USED

in amazon jdk we dont have to pay squat for deployment configuration while oracle has to be set up
and and have to pay for production level projects


JAVA SE implementation is the softeare that is implemented through JAVD JDK
CBSE: JAVA SE
NCERT: JAVA JDK

bite code file name will be the name of papa class 

jvm converts the java code to machine dependent machine understandable bite code

jvm (java virtual machine )  is platform dependent 

if there are more than 1 class in a file than different bute codes will be created for all the classes and only one of all the classes can run at a time

if we make a class public it's name of the file can only be the name of the public 

only one class can be public as file can be named after only one class and file cant have more than one name at a time


if class is empty than still bite code will be generated but cant be executed

The JVM is called a "virtual machine" because it's a software-based, abstract environment that mimics a physical computer,
 providing a consistent platform for Java bytecode to run:
 1. interpreting bytecode into native machine code for any specific OS. 
 2. making Java "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) by abstracting away the underlying hardware and operating system.
 3. This virtual layer translates the universal bytecode into platform-specific instructions for Windows, macOS, Linux, etc., enabling Java's famous portability. 

create project->src(right click)->create package->name(industry standard is "com.chitkara---->ulta domain")
 java class should be kept inside a package (it is recomended)

 ALL CLASS OF JAVA HAS  A SUPERPARENT AND IS CALLED "Objectclass"--->it also belongs to a package called Lang package

 "PACKAGE" -->first keyword of a JAVA CLASS AND PROGRAMME

 com.chitkara.Demo is the full name of the Demo class

 lang package is already in the ide and need not be imported 

 Package is used to avoid naming conviction problem as if Demo is created by some other person as well
 Package can provide some level of security with the help of access modifiers.
